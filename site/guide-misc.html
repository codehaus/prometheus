<h2>Latch</h2>
<p>
    A <a href="http://prometheus.codehaus.org/javadoc/org/codehaus/prometheus/util/Latch.html">Latch</a>
    is single shot waiting mechanism. As long as the latch is closed, all passing threads block until
    the latch opens (or until a timeout occurs or the waiting thread is interrupted). As soon as it
    is opened, all waiting threads wake up and exit the wait call. Once the Latch is opened, it can't
    be closed again (single shot). If a threads wants to wait on a Latch that already is open, it doesn't need to wait
    and can return immediately. After the Latch has been opened, subsequent calls to the open method are ignored.
    Latches are useful if you need to wait for something to reach some final state, like waiting for the
    complete shutdown of a threadpool structure.
</p>

<pre>
private final Latch latch = new JucLatch();

public void awaitShutdown()throws InterruptedEception{
    latch.await();
}

private void markAsShutdown(){
    latch.open();	
}

</pre>
<p>
    At the moment the only implementation is the JucLatch: juc stands for java.util.concurrent because the JucLatch
    is based on the
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html">java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock</a>
    and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html">java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition</a>.
</p>

<h2>Creating threads with the StandardThreadFactory</h2>
<p>
    The java.util.concurrent library has a factory interface for creating threads: the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadFactory.html">ThreadFactory</a>.
    The strange thing is that there is no customizable implementation of that interface. That is why I added one
    to Prometheus: the
    <a href="http://prometheus.codehaus.org/javadoc/org/codehaus/prometheus/util/StandardThreadFactory.html">StandardThreadFactory</a>.
    All kinds of properties can be set, like priorities, threadgroup, name etc.
</p>

<h2>UninterruptibleSection</h2>
<p>
    In some cases you can't/won't deal with a call that can be interrupted by an InterruptedException. For these
    situations I have made a structure: the <a
        href="http://prometheus.codehaus.org/javadoc/main/org/codehaus/prometheus/uninterruptiblesection/UninterruptibleSection.html">UninterruptibleSection</a>.
    <br/>
    In the example you can see an uninterruptible wait on a latch. The interruptible await call on the latch
    is wrapped inside an UninterruptibleSection.
</p>
<pre>
final Latch latch = new JucLatch();

void waitUninterruptibly(){
   new UninterruptibleSection(){
      Object originalsection()throws InterruptedException{
         latch.await();
         return null;            
      }
   }.execute();
}
</pre>
<p>
    There also is an uninterruptible section that uses a timeout:
    the <a
        href="http://prometheus.codehaus.org/javadoc/main/org/codehaus/prometheus/uninterruptiblesection/TimedUninterruptibleSection.html">TimedUninterruptibleSection</a>.
</p>
<pre>
void tryAwaitUninterruptibly(long timeout, TimeUnit unit){
   new TimedUninterruptibleSection(){
      Object originalSection(long timeoutNs)throws InterruptedException, TimeoutException{
         latch.tryAwait(timeoutNs, TimeUnit.NANOS);
         return null;
      }
   }.execute(timeout,unit);
}
</pre>
<p>
    It executes the original section with the timeout. If the tryAwait is interrupted, the TimedUninterruptibleSection
    calculates how much timeout is left, and calls the original section again with the remaining timeout. This process
    is repeated until the tryAwait succeeds or a timeout occurs.
    <br/>
    When closures are introduced in Java 7, they can replace the current clumsy inner class approach.
</p>


<h2>RunnableChain</h2>
<p>
A RunnableChain makes it easy to chain some runnables. In a lot of cases some kind of object needs to be
    created to chain a set of calls. If we are chaining a set of tasks, we would get something like this:
</p>
<pre>
    public class TaskA implements Runnable{...}

    public class TaskB implements Runnable{...}

    public class TaskAB implements Runnable{
        private final TaskA taska;
        private final TaskB taskb;

        TaskAB(TaskARunnable taska, TaskBRunnable taskb){
            this.taska = taska;
            this.taskb = taskb;
        }

        public void run(){
            taska.run();
            taskb.run();
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    TaskAB in most cases it not very interesting itself (just a configuration detail), and in my opinion
    introduces a lot of noise (interfaces/implementations/tests). Noise prevents you from focusing on the
    stuff that is interesting/important (and plumbing in most cases isn't). That is why the RunnableChain
    is introduced. 
</p>
<h3>RunnableChain and exceptions</h3>        
<p>
    When an exception occurs in a RunnableChain, the other elements in the chain are not executed. In
    some cases this causes serious problems (especially some business process that is broken because a step in
    that process keeps failing). But if the steps are isolated, failure of one step doesn't mean failure of
    the others. That is why a RunnableChain can be made unbreakable by setting the unbreakable property.
    When the unbreakable property is set, and an unchecked exception occurs, this exception is caught
    (and passed to an ExceptionHandler so you have the chance to do some logging) and finally it is thrown away
    so the next step can be executed.
</p>
<h3>RunnableChain in Spring</h3>
<p>
    A RunnableChain is useful for wiring up services that need to be hooked to some
    kind of trigger (Quartz for example) that also expects some form of Runnable. In Spring you have the
    MethodInvokingFactoryBean that makes it easy to execute a method on some bean. The RunnableChain makes
    it possible to execute a chain of such calls.
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;bean id=&quot;servicea&quot; class=&quot;....&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;bean id=&quot;serviceb&quot; class=&quot;....&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;bean id=&quot;taskab&quot; class=&quot;org.codehaus.prometheus.util.ChainedRunnable&quot;&gt;
        &lt;constructor-arg&gt;
            &lt;list&gt;
                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.scheduling.support.MethodInvokingRunnable&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;property name=&quot;targetObject&quot; ref=&quot;serviceA&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;property name=&quot;targetObject&quot; value=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;/bean&gt;
                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.scheduling.support.MethodInvokingRunnable&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;property name=&quot;targetObject&quot; ref=&quot;serviceB&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;property name=&quot;targetObject&quot; value=&quot;foo&quot;/&gt;
                &lt;/bean&gt;
            &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;/constructor-arg&gt;
        &lt;property name=&quot;unbreakable&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/bean&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    If you want to hook this up with Quartz, you need to wrap the taskab in a
    org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.DelegatingJob. And I realize that XML configuration is quite
verbose, I hope this can be solved in the near future by providing some form of DSL.
