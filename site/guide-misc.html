<h1>Miscelanious guide</h1>
<p>
    This guide describes various other concurrency structures that can be found in the Prometheus library.
</p>

<h2>Latch</h2>
<p>
    A Latch is a single shot mechanism (after is has been opened, it never can be closed again) threads can wait on. As
    long as the Latch is closed, threads block (unless they are interrupted or a timeout occurs). As soon as it opens,
    all waiting threads can proceed. After the Latch has been opened, all threads that want to pass the Latch pass it
    without waiting. Latches are very useful for waiting on state changes that are final, like waiting on the shutdown
    of a
    Repeater.
</p>

<pre>
    final Latch latch = new Latch();

    void foo(){
        Thread t1 = new WaitingThread();
        t1.start();
        Thread t2 = new WaitingThread();
        t2.start();

        latch.open();
        ..
    }

    class WaitingThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){
            try{
                latch.await();
            }catch(InterruptedException ex){
                //ignore
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

<h2>Creating threads with the StandardThreadFactory</h2>
<p>
    The new concurrency library found in Java 5 and higher already has a factory interface for creating thread.
    The strange thing is that there is no customizable implementation of that interface. That is why I added it
    to Prometheus: StandardThreadFactory. All kinds of properties can be set, most important ones is priorities
    (make sure that batch threads, have a low priority).
</p>

<h2>UninterruptibleSection</h2>
<p>
    In some cases you can't/won't deal with a call that can be interrupted by an InterruptedException. For these
    situations I have made a structure: the UninterruptibleSection.
</p>
<pre>
    final Latch latch = new Latch();

    void waitUninterruptibly(){
        new UninterruptibleSection(){
            Object originalsection()throws InterruptedException{
                latch.await();
                return null;
            }
        }.execute();
    }
</pre>
<p>
    There also is an uninterruptible section that uses a timeout:
</p>
<pre>
    void tryAwaitUninterruptibly(long timeout, TimeUnit unit){
        new TimedUninterruptibleSection(){
            Object originalSection(long timeoutNs)throws InterruptedException, TimeoutException{
                latch.tryAwait(timeoutNs, TimeUnit.NANOS);
                return null;
            }
        }.execute(timeout,unit);
    }
</pre>
<p>
    It keeps repeating the original section until a timeout occurrs, or when the section returns or receives
    a timeout.
</p>
