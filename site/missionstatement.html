<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<ol>
     <li>
        provide higher order concurrency structures if possible, to prevent using lower order structures like mutexes
        and semaphores. It doesn't mean these structures are bad, but especially with multi-threaded code, a higher
        abstraction can reduce concurrency control related complexity much better.
    </li>
    <li>
        promote externalization of threading. Integration of threading in objects makes them hard to test, hard to
        reuse, hard to modify and often the quality is something that can be improved. In most cases it is better to
        externalize the threading completely and let a few specialized structures deal with it.
