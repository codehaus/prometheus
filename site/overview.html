<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    Prometheus is a concurrency library for Java 5 and higher and will be released under the
    MIT license. The main goal of the project is to provide higher level concurrency control abstractions to
    reduce concurrency control related complexity. Prometheus relies on the java.util.concurrent library
    that is introduced in Java 5 and tries to make use of this package where possible.
</p>

<h3>First release</h3>
<p>
The first release candidate of version 0.1 has been <a href="download.html">released</a>. No new
functionality will be added to the first release, the primary focus will be on improving tests
(unit/integration/performance) and documentation.
</p>
<p>
The following features are planned for the first release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>AwaitableReference</b>: a synchronization abstraction that makes
        it easy to pass references from one thread to another or block if no
        reference is available.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>LendableReference</b>: a synchronization abstraction that extends
        the AwaitableReference and adds the concept of taking back items.
        This provides a way to control which references are lend: if a LendableReference
        is strict, it doesn't allow different references to be lend at any given moment. If
        a new reference is set, the call blocks until all lend references are returned. The
        opposite of the strict version is the relaxed LendableReference: it doesn't care
        if different references are lend at any given moment, so placing a new item
        can be done without long blocking.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Repeater</b>: a threadpool structure that is responsible for
        repeating tasks. An <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html">Executor</a>
        is great for executing a task once, but a Repeater provides a better abstraction for repeatedly
        executing tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>BlockingExecutor</b>: a threadpool structure like the
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.6.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html">Executor</a>
        but provides more control on blocking and timeout behaviour.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>ConditionUtil &amp; LockUtil</b>: contain various functions for
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html">Lock</a>

        and <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/Condition.html">Condition</a>
        instances.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>UninterruptibleSection</b>: provides a way to do interruptible
        calls in locations where you can't deal with interrupts.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Latch</b>: a synchronization abstraction that provides a single
        shot waiting mechanism. It can be used to wait for a final state change to
        occur, like the complete shutdown of a Repeater for example.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>JMX</b>: MBeans for various structures so they can be controlled
        in a serverside environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Test support</b>: a set of classes/interfaces and utilities to
        test multi-threaded code.
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Future features</h3>

<p>
A lot of functionality has been removed from the first version, to prevent
delaying an initial release indefinitely, and moved to a later version. But a lot of nice
features (the best ones imho) are planned:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Channels</b>: a data exchange abstraction. A <a
            href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html">BlockingQueue</a>
        can be quite troublesome when you are working with producer/consumer
        solutions because they have many responsibilities:
        <ol>
            <li>placement of items (put/offer methods)</li>
            <li>storage of items (it extends the <a
                    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html">Collection</a> interface)
            </li>

            <li>retrieval of items (take, poll methods)</li>
        </ol>
        That makes BlockingQueues hard to customize (like routing, filtering and multicasting)
        and that is why these aspects are separated with Channels:
        <ol>
            <li>the OutputChannel is responsible for placement of items</li>
            <li>the InputChannel is responsible for retrieval of items</li>
        </ol>
        In most cases these are the only aspects you are interested in. With channels you can create very complex
        systems and customizable systems without having to integrating this logic into components. JMS also is a data
        exchange abstraction, but it is meant for inter virtual machine communication (so communication between vm's)
        and not intra vm communication (communication inside the vm) and this makes it a less attractive if you just
        need to exchange data between threads. The original concurrency library Doug Lea created, contained a similar structure:
        <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/Takable.java">Takable</a> and
        <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/Puttable.java">Puttable</a> but
        unfortunately they were integrated into the BlockingQueue.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Processes &amp; Processors</b>: provide a 'framework' for setting up assembly lines ('pipes
        and filters'). And can be used to set up applications that need to process large amounts of data
        like batch applications. The main goal is to separate 2 aspects:
        <ol>
            <li>the actual processing of messages (in most cases some form of transformation)</li>
            <li>
		plumbing: connecting processes (either directly or by some form of queueing), threading, 
		exception handling and pattern matching on message type.
	    </li>
        </ol>
        Often these 2 aspects are integrated and form a monolithic piece of code is very hard to
	test, to maintain, to understand, to change.By separating these aspects, one
        can wire up the same processes in a different manner (sequential, a pipeline, parallel) 
	and this makes a system much more flexible. Another important goal is to make it easy to 
	wire Processes up in Spring (or any other IOC-container) so you can combine the functionality of
	Processes with the power of Spring.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Waitpoint</b>: an abstraction for blocking behaviour. By injecting
        different waitpoints one is able to customize the blocking behaviour of
        various components. One of the usages would be a BlockingQueue that
        is able to throttle the intake of items, or is able to pauze the taking
        of items. This could be used to make an Executor pause for example.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Waitsections</b>: extend the concept of Waitpoints. Waitpoints don't have any with, you either
        in front of a waitpoint, or you have passed it. With a Waitsection there is a period a thread is
        inside the waitpoint.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Deadlock safe calls</b>: writing deadlock free code can be very complicated (almost impossible)
        but deadlocks can be prevented. Deadlock detection is not obligated by the JVM, but another solution
        is to limit the amount of time for waiting on a resource (like a Lock). But adding timeouts to calls
        can be quite cumbersome: you don't want to administrate the timeout with every call. That is why I'm
        going to introduce 'safe' calls: call that use a timeout but don't require you to deal with the
        administration. A threadlocal is used to store the timeout, this value can be set at the beginning of
        the callstack, and will decrease each time some sort of locking occurs.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Recommended literature</h3>
<p>

    Concurrency control is a very complex subject and good preparation is advisable. And although this library
    tries to reduce complexity, I think it is important that you know what you are doing. Two Java books that
    really helped me a lot, are the following classics:
