Documentation is going to be added before the 0.1 release.

<h2>Test the state a thread is in</h2>
<p>
    Explain why the Thread.getState() can't be used (JCiP).
</p>

<h2>Tests for the termination of a Thread</h2>
<p>
    There are various methods that can be used for asserting that the thread is finished:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>assertIsTerminated</li>
    <li>assertIsTerminatedWithoutThrowing</li>
    <li>assertIsTerminatedWithException</li>
    <li>etc</li>
</ol>

<h2>Test that a Thread is blocking</h2>
<p>
    There is no way to detect of a thread is blocking within the JVM. The Thread.getState can't be trusted
    for providing the actual state the thread is in. The only thing that can be done is to ask the thread
    if it is still running by calling the assertIsStarted().
</p>

<h2>Test if exception is thrown</h2>
<p>
    If you want to check if a thread has terminated, but no exception was thrown, use the following:
<pre>
    TestThread t = ...;
    t.assertTerminatedWithoutThrowing()
    </pre>

If you want to check if a specific exception was thrown, you can use the following:
<pre>
    TestThread t = ...;
    t.assertTerminatedWithException(RejectedExecutionException.class)
    </pre>

If have a reference to the exception, you can also use the following assert statement:
<pre>
        Exception ex = ....;
        TestThread t = ...;
        t.assertTerminatedWithException()
    </pre>
</p>

<h2>Test for interruption</h2>
<p>
    You can test if a thread is terminated with an InterruptedException by calling
    Thread.assertIsInterruptedByException(). If you want to check the the interrupt flag
    is set, you can call the 
</p>

<h2>Keeping track of created threads</h2>
<p>
    TracingThreadFactory.
