<h3>AwaitableReference</h3>
<p>
The AwaitableReference is a synchronization structure that makes it easy to wait on the availability of
a reference. I guess this is not something that needs to be done often, but I use this synchronization structure
within Prometheus.

<h3>LendableReference</h3>
<p>
    The LendableReference extends the AwaitableReference but adds the concept of lending a reference:
    a lend reference needs to be taken back.

<ol>
    <li>StrictLendableReference: a LendableReference that is strict (doesn't allow different references
    to be lend at any given moment. So before a new reference can be set, all previous lend references
        need to be taken back.
    </li>
    <li>RelaxedLendableReference: a LendableReference that is relaxed. It allows different references
    to be lend at any given moment. So a new reference can be set before any previous reference is
    returned.</li>
</ol>
