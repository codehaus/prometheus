<h2>Repeating tasks with the Repeater</h2>
<p>
The Repeater, and the default implementation ThreadPoolRepeater, can be used for 
the repeated execution of a task. The Executor is better suited for executing 
a task once and although it can be modified by using a work queue that keeps 
giving out the same task, I don't think it is the right abstraction. 
<br/>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
public class SomeRepeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean run(){
        System.out.println("Hello");
        return true;
    }
}

Repeatable task new RepeatableRunnable(new SomeRunnable();
ThreadPoolRepeater repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(1);
repeater.repeat(task);
</pre>

<h3>Interpreting the return value of the Repeatable</h3>
<p>
    There are different policies for dealing with the return value:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>EndTask</b>: stops executing the repeatable. But doesn't shut down the threadpool,
        so the Repeater is able to execute a new Repeatable.
    </li>
    <li><b>EndWorker</b>: stops the thread that executed the repeatable. If other threads
        receive true, they can continue (the repeatable is not changed).
    </li>
    <li><b>EndRepeater</b>: stops the Repeater</li>
</ol>

<h2>Repeating a Runnable</h2>
<p>
In some cases it is easier to use a Runnable instead of a Repeatable. That is why 
an adapter is created: the RepeatableRunnable. It can be extended and the 
Repeatable.run() method needs to be overridden, or a Runnable can be injected.
<br/>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
Runnable runnable = new SomeRunnable();
Repeatable task = new RepeatableRunnable(runnable);
repeater.repeat(task);        
</pre>
<p>
The reason why this adapter is created is because a lot of functionality already 
is available for Runnables, eg the MethodInvokingRunnable from the Spring framework 
(Spring is my framework of choice).
</p>

<h2>Stopping a Repeater</h2>
<p>
A Repeater can be stopped by placing a null task in the repeater, or let the Repeatable 
return false (it also sets the task to null). A different way to stop a Repeater is
to shut it down by calling the shutdown or shutdownNow method. The difference between 
the shutdown methods and placing a null task (or let the repeatable return false) is
that the first one is final. So once a Repeater has shut down, it can't be activated 
again. In one of the next releases of Prometheus I'm going to add pausing functionality.
</p>

<h2>Repeaters and multiple threads</h2>
<p>
The ThreadPoolRepeater has a pool of threads where all threads are running the same task 
concurrently. The poolsize can be set in the constructor, but it also can be set after 
creation. This can be done with the 'setDesiredPoolSize' method. 
</p>

<h3>Using a Repeater to set up assemblylines</h3>
<p>
Repeaters are very handy if you want to set up a processing assembly line (production 
line, pipes/filters).
<br/>
Example:
</p>
<pre>
BlockingQueue queue1 = new LinkedBlockingQueue(10);
BlockingQueue queue2 = new LinkedBlockingQueue(10);
BlockingQueue queue3 = new LinkedBlockingQueue(10);

public class Process1Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue1.take();
        e.action1();
        queue2.put(e);
        return true;
    }
}

public class Process2Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue2.take();
        e.action2();
        queue3.put(e);
        return true;
    }
}

public class Process3Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue3.take();
        e.action3();
        database.save(e);
    }
}

Repeater process1Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater();
process1Repeater.repeat(new Process1Runnable());

Repeater process2Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater();
process2Repeater.repeat(new Process2Runnable());

Repeater process3Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater();
process3Repeater.repeat(new Process3Repeatable());
</pre>
<p>
As you can see the there is no thread creation logic of repeating logic inside the 
components. This is an example of code I usually see:
</p>
<pre>
class Processor{

    void start(){
        new Thread(){
            public void run(){
                while(true){
                    Employee e = queue1.take();
                    e.action1();
                    queue2.put(e);
                }
            }
        }.start();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This is a nightmare to modify, test or reuse. So externalize threading if you can.
<p/>

<h2>JMX and Repeaters</h2>
<p>
The ThreadPoolRepeater has a JMX MBean, that makes it possible to control a ThreadPoolRepeater
by JMX. 
</p>

<h2>Strict or not strict</h2>
<p>
In most cases the task a Repeater executes isn't changed after construction. But there are 
always situations where you do need to change the task. Unfortunately changing tasks is not without 
problems either: if multiple threads in the threadpool of the ThreadPoolRepeater are executing
some task, and if a new task is placed, it could be that at the same moment different tasks 
are executed parallel. This behaviour can be controlled by making a Repeater strict 
or relaxed:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>a <b>strict</b> repeater doesn't allow concurrent execution of different tasks</li>
    <li>a <b>relaxed</b> repeater does allow concurrent execution of different tasks</li>
</ol>
<p>
This behavior can be controlled by providing a true/false in the constructor, but at a deeper 
level it is controlled by using different types of LendableReferences. A StrictLendableReference 
makes a strict Repeater possible, and a RelaxedLendableReference makes a relaxed Repeater possible.
</p>

<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<p>
Exception handling often is something that could be improved. Especially when you are working 
with threads yourself and are responsible for the calls in the top of the callstack, good 
exception handling could be a real life saver. The ThreadPoolRepeater uses an ExceptionHandler 
to report exceptions. After the worker uses the exception handler, it returns to the pool so 
it can be used for the following execution. For the rare situations that the thread needs to 
shutdown after it reports an error, a repeatable decorator could be created that returns false 
as soon as it throws an exception.
</p>

<p>
Standard all exceptions are handled with the PrintStreamExceptionHandler that logs all exceptions 
to the System.out. Next to the this exceptionhandler there also is one for Log4J: Log4jExceptionHandler.
