<h1>Repeater guide</h1>

<h2>Repeating tasks with the Repeater</h2>
The Repeater, and the default implementation ThreadPoolRepeater, can be used for the repeated execution
of a task. The Executor is better suited for executing a task once and altough it can be modified by
using a work queue that keeps giving out the same task, I don't think it is the right abstraction. 

Example:
<pre>
public class SomeRepeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean run(){
        System.out.println("Hello");
        return true;
    }
}

Repeatable task new RepeatableRunnable(new SomeRunnable();
ThreadPoolRepeater repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(1);
repeater.repeat(task);
</pre>

<h2>Repeating a Runnable</h2>
In some cases it is easier to use a Runnable instead of a Repeatable. That is why an adapter is created:
the RepeatableRunnable. It can be extended and the Repeatable.run() method needs to be overriden, or
a Runnable can be injected.

Example:
<pre>
Runnable runnable = new SomeRunnable();
Repeatable task = new RepeatableRunnable(runnable);
repeater.repeat(task);        
</pre>

The reason why this adapter is created is because a lot of functionality already is available for
Runnables, eg the MethodInvokingRunnable from the Spring framework (Spring is my framework of choice).

<h2>Stopping a Repeater</h2>
A Repeater can be stopped by placing a null task in the repeater, or let the Repeatable return false (it also
sets the task to null). A different
way to stop a Repeater is to shut it down by calling the shutdown method. The difference between the shutdown and
placing a null task (or let the repeatable return false) is that the first one is final. So once a Repeater has
shut down, it can't be actived again. In one of the next releases of Prometheus I'm going to add pauzing functionality.
This can be done (quite easily) by using a LendableReference decorator: LendableReferenceWithWaitingTakes in combination
with a CloseableWaitpoint.

<h2>Repeaters and multiple threads in the threadpool</h2>
The ThreadPoolRepeater has a pool of threads where all threads are running the same task concurrently. The poolsize
can be set in the constructor, but it also can be set after creation. This can be done with the 'setPoolSize' method.

<h3>Using a Repeater to set up assemblylines</h3>
Repeaters are very handy if you want to set up a processing assembly line (production line, pipes/filters) for example...

Example:        
<pre>
BlockingQueue queue1 = new LinkedBlockingQueue();
BlockingQueue queue2 = new LinkedBlockingQueue();
BlockingQueue queue3 = new LinkedBlockingQueue();

public class Process1Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue1.take();
        e.action1();
        queue2.put(e);
        return true;
    }
}

public class Process2Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue2.take();
        e.action2();
        queue3.put(e);
        return true;
    }
}

public class Process3Repeatable implements Repeatable{
    public boolean execute()throws Exception{
        Employee e = queue3.take();
        e.action3();
        database.save(e);
    }
}

Repeater process1Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(1);
process1Repeater.repeat(new Process1Runnable());

Repeater process2Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(1);
process2Repeater.repeat(new Process2Runnable());

Repeater process3Repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(1);
process3Repeater.repeat(new Process3Repeatable());
</pre>

As you can see the there is no thread creation logic of repeating logic inside the components. This is an example
you usually see:

<pre>
class Processor{

    void start(){
        new Thread(){
            public void run(){
                while(true){
                    Employee e = queue1.take();
                    e.action1();
                    queue2.put(e);
                }
            }
        }.start();
    }
}
</pre>
This is a nightmare to modify, test or reuse. So externalize threading if you can.
<p/>
There are some things you have to watch out for. One of the problems is that if multiple threads are used in a repeater
that is could happen that a messages are processed out of order. Luckely in most cases this is not in issue, but for
those cases it is a problem I already have a synchronization stone in the sandbox: Resequencer that solves this problem.
sandbox.
<p/>
Another advantage of assembly lines is that they make it possible to make better of resources. Multiple cpu's can be
used instead of it all running on a single cpu. And with a single thread, you normally have one of the following two
things:
<ol>
    <li>cpu burst</li>
    <li>io burst</li>
</ol>
The problem is that while you have a cpu burst, no io is being performed. And while you are having a cpu burst, no io
is being performed. The advantage of an assembly lines is that the processes are not synchronous: each process can run
as fast as it can, so if a process is doing io, others could do cpu.

<h2>JMX and Repeaters</h2>
The ThreadPoolRepeater has a JMX MBean, that makes it possible to control a ThreadPoolRepeater by JMX.

<h2>Strict or not strict Repeaters</h2>
In most cases the task a Repeater executes isn't changed after construction. But there are always situations where you
do need to change the task. But changing tasks is not without problems either: if multiple threads in the threadpool
of the ThreadPoolRepeater are executing some task, and if a new task is placed, it could be that at the same moment
multiple threads are executing different tasks. This behaviour can be controlled by making a Repeater strict or relaxed:
<ol>
    <li>a <b>strict</b> repeater doesn't allow concurrent execution of different tasks</li>
    <li>a <b>relaxed</b> repeater does allow concurrent execution of different tasks</li>
</ol>
This behaviour can be controlled by prividing a true/false in the constructor, but at a deeper level it is controlled
by using different types of LendableReferences. A StrictLendableReference makes a strict Repeater possible, and a
RelaxedLendableReference makes a relaxed Repeater possible.

<h2>Exception handling</h2>
<p>
Exception handling often is something that could be improved. Especially when you are working with threads yourself
and are responsible for the calls in the top of the callstack, good exception handling could be a real life saver.
The ThreadPoolRepeater uses an ExceptionHandler to report exceptions. After the worker uses the exception handler, it
returns to the pool so it can be used for the following execution. For the rare situations that the thread needs to
shutdown after it reports an error, a repeatable decorator could be created that returns false as soon as it throws
an exception.
</p>

<p>
Standard all exceptions are handled with the PrintStreamExceptionHandler that logs all exceptions to the
System.out. Next to the this exceptionhandler there also is one for Log4J: Log4jExceptionHandler.
</p>



<h3>Future improvements</h3>
Setting up factory lines always gives me a kick, but I know it can be complex. That is why I'm working on some components
that can be used to set up factory lines. The only thing that needs to be provided is one of the following methods:

<pre>
Object process(Object o);
void process(Object)
</pre>

Taking data from queues, and placing on the following queues, dealing with timeouts, dealing with exceptions is all
taken care of. The only thing that needs to be done is select a Processor (a structure that executes a process method)
and hook it up to a Repeater, and even this can be simplified by using some sort of facade.
<p/>
Another improvement is the introduction of channels (Takeable and Puttable from Doug Lea). BlockingQueue's have too
many responsibilities: placement of items, taking of items, storage of items. With channels these responsibilities
are divided.
