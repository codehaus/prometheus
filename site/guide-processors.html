<h2>Process guide</h2>
<p>
    This documentation is under construction. The functionality is still is in the
    sandbox. At the moment it is being used in an experimental project within <a href="http://www.xebia.com">Xebia</a>:
    the company I'm part of. We use Prometheus as execution environment, and Terracotta as distribution mechanism.
</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
    Creating multithreaded application is going to be more important, because of the increasing number of
    cores on cpu's. The classic approach to concurrency control is procedure calls, but the big
    problem is that it can be very complicated because of the synchronization (not enough synchronization
    leads to race problems and too much synchronization leads to liveness problems).
</p>
<p>
    A different approach to writing multithreaded applications is message passing. With message passing
    an message (just an object) only can be touched by at most a single thread at any moment and this prevents a lot of
    complexity. But message passing is not without problems either; the core logic (the transformation
    of messages) often is polluted with infrastructural plumbing (threading, taking messages from queues,
    putting messages on queues). The process functionality of Prometheus provides a lot of
    inner-virtual machine plumbing and makes it easy to hook up tuple spaces (Javaspaces/Gigaspaces, but
    also JMS and Terracotta) if . So the goal is not to create another data distribution technology,
    but rather to complement these technologies.

    This goal is realized by acknowledging the 2 different hats a
</p>
<ol>
    <li>the core processing logic; transforming </li>
    <li>wiring up the processes</li>    
</ol>

    Make it easy to use multi-threading, focus on core logic and not on plumbing/infrastructure for blocking
    and passing data, lightweight and powerful execution environment for multithreading and
    distributed computing. There also is a large overlap with batch processing, although this is not
    a batching framework, so no functionality can be found for tracking batches, restarting them etc.

      pipes and filters architectural patterns, spring friendly (di) but not tied to the spring framework.
        can be used to write non distributed as wel as distributed applications.
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
    The most important concept you need to understand for the Process functionality, is the Process.
    So what is a process:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Something that generates data: eg reading lines of text from a file, or reading records from the database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Something that consumes data: eg writing output to database or file, or writing records to the database.
    </li>
    <li>
        Something that transforms data: eg changes the state of domain objects like
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Processes in Prometheus</h3>
<p>
    A Process in Prometheus can be any POJO, so you don't need to implement any interfaces or extend
    classes. A Process only needs to have one or more receive methods for every type of message (also POJO's)
    it wants to receive. The following example is a process that transforms (replaces) a number by
    adding one to it.
</p>
<pre>
    class AddOneProcess{

        public Integer receive(Integer value){
            return value++;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    As you can see the code is very clear:
<ol>
    <li>
        there is no logic for figuring out which receive method to use. The example only contains a single
        receive method, but multiple receive methods can be declared inside a single process (link to
        documentation).
    </li>
    <li>
        there is no logic how to get the value: maybe it needs to be taken from some kind of queue or
        is the output of another process. Removing this logic, makes it easy to 'wire' up the same process
        in a different context. This property can be very handy if you are still looking for the right
        setup for the processes. Another advantage is that testing is easier because no blocking on
        queues takes place in the process, so you only need to test the core logic and not the infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>
        there is no logic how to get rid of the value : maybe it needs to be put on some kind of queue or
        it could also be the input of another process. So the previous item for advantages.
    </li>
    <li>
        no looping. If you need to run the process, on a stream of values, you normally get some kind of
        loop in your system that keeps running the process. Such loops can be hard to test.
    </li>
    <li>
        no internal threading logic: threading can be very hard, and having to deal with it all the time,
        is just asking for problems. Threading can be externalized (in case of the Processor functionality,
        the ThreadPoolRepeater (link to documentation) is responsible for this task.
    </li>
    <li>
        no exception handling logic: a process could fail for some reason, but you want to externalize
        this plumbing so the process only needs to focus on the core logic. Prometheus contains various
        policies that can be used to deal with exceptions (link to these policies).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The process functionality is not the magic solution if you need to deal with messages. In some cases you
    need to deal with multiple queues, timeouts etc. If that is the case you can always go a step lower:
    and write a processor (an environment for executing a process) yourself.
</p>

<h4>What is is not</h4>
<ol>
    <li>data/object distribution technology like JMS, Terracotta, Javaspaces. The main task of these
        technologies is the distribution of data in a cluster. The process functionality from Prometheus,
        focusses on executing processes inside a single virtual machine. If data needs to be distributed
        in a cluster, you could combine Prometheus with one of these technologies. At the moment, different
        channel (link to documentation) experimental implementation have been made for Terracotta and
        Gigaspaces.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Multiple receive methods</h4>
<p>
    You can also create multiple receive methods:
</p>
<pre>
    class AddOneProcess{

        public Integer receive(Integer value){
            return value++;
        }

        public Float receive(Float value){
            return value++;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Multiple receive methods can be used to deal with 'poison' messages.
</p>
<pre>
    class FileWritingProcess{
        FileWriter writer;

        public void receive(String s){
            writer.write(s);
        }

        public void receive(StartOfStreamEvent e){
            writer = new FileWriter(e.getOutputFile());
        }

        public void receive(EndOfStreamEvent e){
            writer.close();
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Todo: ambiguity, most strict receive.
</p>

<h4>Using a wildcard</h4>
<p>
    Using a wildcard (wildcard is nothing special.. just a receive that accepts any
    Object).
</p>
<pre>

    class LoggingProcess{
        Logger logger = ....

        public void receive(Object o){
            logger.info(o);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    A wildcard can be used in combination with normal receive methods:
</p>
<pre>
    class LoggingProcess{
        Logger logger = ....

        public void receive(Integer i){
            logger.info("Woehoe.. it was an integer: "+i);
        }

        public void receive(Object o){
            logger.info(o);
        }
    }
</pre>

<h4>No match?</h4>
<p>
    If there is no matching receive, nothing bad happens. The message won't be gobbled up.
</p>

<h4>Returning void</h4>
<p>
    If the received object is transformed, you don't need to declare a return type:
</p>
<pre>
    class FireProcess{

        public void receive(Employee e){
            e.fire();
        }
    }
</pre>

<h4>Returning null</h4>
<p>
    There is no difference between returning the received message, and returning void.
    If you want to gobble up a message, you can return null.
</p>
<pre>
    class EvenNumberFilter{

        public Integer receive(Integer i){
            return i%2==0:i?null;
        }
    }
</pre>

<h4>Returning an Iterator</h4>
<p>
    In some cases you don't know the number of items that need to be returned in
    advance (for example when you have some form of parsing process):
</p>
<pre>
    class ParsingProcess{

        public Iterator&lt;String&gt; receive(File file){
            return new LineIterator(file);
        }

        //the SomeReader doesn't exist btw
        class LineIterator implements Iterator&lt;String&gt;{
            SomeReader reader;

            LineIterator(File file){
                reader = new SomeReader(file);
            }

            boolean hasNext(){
                reader.hasMoreLines();
            }

            String next(){
                reader.readLine();
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    Support for other structures, like java.util.Collection/java.util.Iterator and arrays, is planned.
</p>

<h4>Receiving no arguments</h4>
<p>
    The receive method doesn't need to have an argument:
</p>
<pre>
    class NanotimeProcess{
        public Long receive(){
            return System.nanotime();
        }
    }
</pre>
<p>
    It is also possible to give return and have no argument in the receive method:
</p>
<pre>
    class SomeProcess{
        public void receive(){
            System.out.println("hello")
        }
    }
</pre>

<h3>Processors</h3>
<p>
    A Processor is the execution environment for a process. The StandardProcessor is the
    default implementation that uses a InputChannel for input and an OutputChannel for output.
</p>

<h4>Source processor</h4>
<p>
    A source processor is a processor that has no input, only output.
</p>
<pre>
    OutputChannel output = ...
    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(generatingProcess, output);
</pre>

<h4>Piped processor</h4>
<p>
    A piped processor is a processor that has input and output. It doesn't
    mean that for every message that is placed on the input, one message needs
    to be placed on the output.
</p>
<pre>
    InputChannel input = ...
    OutputChannel output = ...
    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(input, transformingProcess, output);
</pre>

<h4>Sink processor</h4>
<p>
    A sink processor is a processor that only has input and no output.
</p>
<pre>
    InputChannel input = ...
    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(input, consumingProcess);
</pre>

<h3>Running processors</h3>
<p>
    The threading logic to run a process, could have been added to the Processor, but
    this would complicate this very important structure. That is why threading has been removed
    completely from the Processor and the only thing that the Processor exposes is
    a method. This method needs to be executed by a Thread and this is a perfect
    task for the Repeater/ThreaPoolRepeater, eg:
</p>
<pre>
    Object sayHelloWorldProcess = Object(){
        void receive(){
            System.out.println("hello world");
        }
    };

    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(sayHelloWorldProcess);
    Repeater repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(new ProcessorRepeatable(processor));
</pre>
<p>
    The ThreadPoolRepeater is a container for threads (just like the ThreadPoolExecutor). The big
    difference between them is that the worker-threads in the ThreadPoolExecutor, try to take some
    work from the workqueue and execute it, or block if no work is available, and the threads in the
    ThreadPoolRepeater all execute the same task over and over again. For more information please check
    the documentation of the Repeater and ThreadPoolRepeater.
</p>

<p>
    Multiple threads/out of order execution
</p>

<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>

</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Process:</b> transforms, consumes or generates messages.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Processor:</b> provides an execution environment for process. It takes care of exceptionhandling,
        dispatching on the receive methods of the process, taking message from a channel or putting message on
        another channel.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Executor:</b> provides the threads to run the Processor.    
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Stopping a processor</h4>
<p>

</p>

<h4>Stopping a single worker</h4>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Setting up a sequential process</h3>
<p>
    If you want to chain a few processes, you can do this:
</p>
<pre>
    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(
        inputChannel,
        new Object[]{process1,process2,process3},
        outputChannel);
</pre>

<h3>Setting up parallel processes</h3>
<p>
    A single process can be run in parallel by placing multiple threads inside
    the threadpool of the Repeater. The same process object now is executed by
    multiple threads concurrently.
</p>
<pre>
    Processor processor = new StandardProcessor(someprocess);
    Repeater repeater = new ThreadPoolRepeater(2,new ProcessorRepeatable(processor));
</pre>
<p>
    Process someprocess now is executed by concurrently (so by multiple threads
    at the same moment). Prometheus doesn't provide an easy way to run every process
    on its own thread. Maybe this is going to be added in the future.
</p>

<h3>Setting up a pipeline of processes</h3>
<p>
</p>
<pre>
    Process1 process1 = new Process1();
    Process2 process2 = new Process2();
    Process3 process3 = new Process3();

    Channel channela = new BufferedChannel();
    Channel channelb = new BufferedChannel();

    Processor processor1 = new Processor(process1, channela);
    Processor processor2 = new Processor(channela, process2, channelb);
    Processor processor3 = new Processor(channelb, process3);
</pre>

<h3>Dealing with exceptions</h3>
<p>
    Exceptions can be thrown by processes:
</p>
<p>
    class FireProcess{
    void receive(Employee e)throws CantFireException{
    if(e.getName().equals("Peter Veentjer"))
    throw CantFireException();
    e.fire();
    }
    }
</p>
<p>
    By injecting an ErrorPolicy in the Processor you can deal with exceptions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Drop_ErrorPolicy</b>: drops the message completely. This is handy if it doesn't matter that
        some data is lost.
    </li>
    <li><b>Ignore_ErrorPolicy</b>: drops the exception, and lets the message that caused the problem continue
        to the next process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Propagate_ErrorPolicy</b>: propagates the Exception so the thread that calls the Processor needs to
        deal with the situation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Replace_ErrorPolicy</b>: replaces the message by something else, for example a CorruptedStream token
        that lets others processes know an error occurred.
    </li>
    <li>
        more
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You are also able to create your own ErrorPolicies is the existing ones don't fit your needs.
</p>

<h3>Dealing with out of order messages</h3>
<p>
    If messages are processed parallel, it could happen they get out of order. To resequence messages
    a ResequenceProcess can be used.
</p>
<pre>
    StandardProcessor processor = new StandardProcessor(
        inputChannel,
        new Object[]{new ResequenceProcess(),new FileWriteProcess()}
    );
</pre>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Fork/Join</h3>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Distribution</h3>
<p>
    JMS, Terracotta etc. The provide middleware, Prometheus provides an execution environment.
</p>

<h3>Why no extra concurrency control required</h3>
<p>
    The processor functionality is just a form of message passing. And although the all messages
    are in a shared memory space, only one thread at a time is able to touch an object (unless some
    object reference is kept). This form of concurrency control is called confinement and is one
    of the best ways to deal with concurrency control.
</p>

<h3>Processors and continuations</h3>
<p>
    The StandardProcessor supports continuations. This makes it possible that a single thread can
    execute multiple processes in 'parallel'. It also makes it easy for thread management to control
    the thread (throttling/pausing, stopping etc) because the thread keeps returning to the bottom of the
    call stack. In the future I want to create a standardprocessor without continuations, and one
    with (because continuations add overhead).
</p>

<h3>Processors and codegeneration</h3>
<p>
    I'm experimenting with code generation instead of using some kind of generic execution mechanism.
    This makes it possible to optimize for certain situations and this can improve performance. The
    code generation makes use of the new compiler api that is available in Java 6. This
    will not be added to Prometheus for some time (I think).
</p>
